This repo contains various scripts, conditions, integrations, etc. that I have built for use with SQLSentry over the years.  Hopefully folks will find these useful

# Unified Alerting
This folder contains all scripts, definitions, etc. required to set up my unified alerting solution.  This solution utilizes a powershell response to run a custom script which can currently send alerts to Teams and ServiceNow via API call as well as send emails.  I have only had the need to build these two, but assuming other systems have APIs, the patterns should be similar enough to make additional integrations fairly easy.

# Conditions
Contains exported condition definitions for custom conditions
